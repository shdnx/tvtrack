Considered e-mail sending services:
- https://mailtrap.io/ selected
- https://postmarkapp.com/ looks really good, but only 100 free e-mails per month, and the first paid tier is $15 / month for up to 15K e-mails which is excessive
- https://www.mailjet.com/

For e-mail templates:
- https://app.postdrop.io/

- CSS inliner: https://htmlemail.io/inline/
