TODO:
- switch to using SQLite instead of a state JSON file
    allow multiple users, i.e. store users and which user is tracking which series
    store also the series poster images in the database instead of in the filesystem
    one update should get into the e-mail notification of every subscribing user
- update all non-ended/cancelled series once per week, staggered throughout the week to minimize the impact on the API
    but, only send the update summary e-mail once per week, since that is good enough for keeping track of changes
    exception: if a new episode is released, then send an e-mail the day after (but a different kind of e-mail)
- set it up to run as a scheduled service in a Docker container
- make a web interface where each user can list / add / remove their tracked series
    could also make a browser extension for adding series by clicking a button on the IMDB or TMDB website
- also keep track of unreleased movies and notify when they come out

Potential ideas:
- we could also keep track of popular shows using https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list and send some recommendations based on that?
- track releases on NCore as well?
- we could track changes via https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/changes-tv-list but I think for now this would lead to having to many more requests than by just querying details directly
