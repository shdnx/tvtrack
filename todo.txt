 - we could also keep track of popular shows using https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list and send some recommendations based on that?
 - track releases on NCore as well?
 - we could track changes via https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/changes-tv-list but I think for now this would lead to having to many more requests than by just querying details directly
 - switch to using SQLite instead of a state JSON file
